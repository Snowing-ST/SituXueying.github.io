<p align="left">My name is Xueying Situ. I'm working at <a href = "http://english.eximbank.gov.cn/" target = "_blank">THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF CHINA </a> since July 2019. I earned my master degree from <a href = "http://sam.cufe.edu.cn/newEnglish/Home.htm" targer = "_blank" >the School of Statistics and Mathematics, the Central University of Finance and Economics</a>, where I got a good grasp of professional skills of data analysis and now still love to code with Python and R. My thesis was <i>Construction and Application of Online News Sentiment Index Based on Deep Learning Text Classification </i>, advised by Dr Miao Liu, whose main content you can find <a href = "http://www.situxueying.site//tags/#Master%20Thesis" target = "_blank" > in this blog </a>. As I hope to work in fintech, I have passed the level2 exam of FRM (a professional exam in financial risk management field). In my leisure time, I like hand-drawing and photography and I'm insterested in psychology and Chinese history. You can see the literature and courses I read and listen to recently in <a href = "http://www.situxueying.site//reading-list.html" target = "_blank"> my Reading-List </a>
